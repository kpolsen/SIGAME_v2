Plot histogram of certain quantity
----------------------------------
The following commands allows the user to plot histograms 
of several galaxies in one plot:

.. code-block:: python

  import sigame as si
  si.plot.histos()

This function will ask the user several questions to determine what to plot 
and for example whether the histograms should be mass-weighted or plain numbers. 
By hitting enter to all answers and thereby selecting the default values, 
the following figure should appear which is a histogram of gas particle masses in 
the original galaxy data:

| For which data type? [default: sim] 
|  sim for raw simulation data (gas/stars/dark matter)
|  gmc for Giant Molecular Clouds
|  dng for Diffuse Neutral Gas
|  dig for Diffuse Ionized Gas...?
| gas or star or dark matter (dm)? [default: gas] ... 
| over what quantity? [default: m]... 
| mass or number-weighted (m vs n)? [default: n] ... 
| logarithmix x-axis? [default: y] ... 
| logarithmix y-axis? [default: y] ... 
| creating new figure
| Change x limits? [default: n] ... 
| Change y limits? [default: n] ... 
| Save figure? [default: n] ... 
| plot another quantity? [default: n] ...

Plot moment 0 map of a line
---------------------------

.. note:: 

  The release version comes with one test galaxy and all the tools to create datacubes with 
  line emission at z=0 for the following lines; [CII]158 and [NII]205. 
  For other redshifts, please contact us. 
  At least one datacube must exist in order to create a moment 0 map.

To create a [CII] moment 0 map, use the following commands:

.. code-block:: python

  import sigame as si
  si.plot.map_line()

And this image should appear as default:

.. image:: z0_CII_G1.png

To change the settings (extent in kpc, line ID, units on map), see documentation of this function 
`here <https://kpolsen.github.io/SIGAME_dev/sigame.html#module-sigame.plot>`_.
